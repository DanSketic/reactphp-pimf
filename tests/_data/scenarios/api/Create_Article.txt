I WANT TO CREATE A ARTICLE VIA API

I have http header 'Content-Type'," 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
I send post '/articles'," ['title' => 'test title'," 'content' => 'test content']"
I see response code is "201"
I see response is json ""
I see response contains 'newId'
I see response matches json type "['newId' => 'integer']"
